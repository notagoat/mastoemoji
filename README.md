# mastoemoji
Fetches Emojis from Mastodon Instances!

## Requirements
  Python 3 with the requests library and enough space

## Running
  
  Once run it will generate all the files in your filesystem needed. Be warned that the size of these files may increase rapidly when the script is run because of all the images.

## Current Features
  - Instances can be selected via the script (Will update to terminal lines or CSV? Who knows!)
  - Creates seperate files for each instance
  - Copies all files into one megafile

## Planned Features
  - Better instance selection
  - Also finding instances
  - Better error logging
  - Moving emojis? Not sure, Would need some more tests
